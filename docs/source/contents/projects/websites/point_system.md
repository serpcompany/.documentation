# Point Systems

## Participation Points

Anything that the user does which contributes to the growth of the website/community/etc. will help them gain points.

- Upvote: 1 point
- Bookmark: 1 point
- Comment: 1 point


## Reputation (Trust) Points

**What is reputation?**

Reputation is how we measure how much the community trusts you. It is earned by receiving positive feedback (such as upvotes) from other community members on comments you post and posts you write that are picked up by our feed.


**What counts towards reputation?**

We introduced a system where you only receive reputation from an upvote on your post or comment if the person who casts that upvote has at least 250 reputation.

This ensures that people can't just add a new account and upvote their own post; only genuine users' votes are counted!

Starting reputation and minimum reputation
Finally we changed the starting and minimum reputation.

The starting reputation used to be 1 point; we have changed it to 10 points to keep it inline with our new scoring.

Additionally it is not possible to get a negative reputation anymore. So reputation will never drop below 0!

Useful comments are the best and easiest way to gain points!

We love comments that help others decide if a post is for them, support the author or offer valuable feedback.

**Here are a few tips on how you can make your comments better:**

- Try to help other users extract new insights from the post you’re commenting on
- Write summaries so that other users can save time reading through the whole post
- Warn if there’s a professional mistake in a post
- Anything else you have in mind, as long as it is respectful and valuable
