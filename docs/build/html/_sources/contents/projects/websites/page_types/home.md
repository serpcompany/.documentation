# Home page

The primary purpose of the homepage is to display "a sample" of the content that is available on the website - from each module - and plenty of interlinking to the various "target pages" within the module, since the `home` page is almost always the strongest page (SEO wise) on the website.

## Sections

### HERO

The hero area should present a main CTA, and optionally a secondary CTA, to the goals of the website - probably to get new email signups (Content Websites), or to start a free trial (SAAS).


### Module sections

The home page needs a "section" to represent each `module` on the website, and provide alot of _interlinking_ to various "target pages" within the module, including:

-  [ ] link to the module's `index page`
-  [ ] multiple links to the module's `category` / `collection` pages
-  [ ] multiple links to the module's `single` pages


### Social proof

Finally, the home page should be sprinkled with various `social proof` elements to make the brand seem legitimate. These might include:

- social proof ribbon
- about us section
- awards section
- testimonials section
- user uploaded content section
- etc.
