# Testing

Write logic tests for all logic files.

## Testing Tools

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) for general testing
- [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) for code coverage
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/) built in testing tool
- [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for type checking and data validation
- [mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for mutation testing
- [django-check-seo](https://github.com/kapt-labs/django-check-seo) although not a traditional "code quality testing tool", there's no point in having a website if our SEO sucks, so we should test for it!

## End-to-end tests
*


## Functional tests
* 


## Unit tests

A good unit test should:
* focus on a single use-case at a time
* have a minimal set of assertions per test
* demonstrate every use case. 
  
Rules of thumb is: 
* if it can happen, it should be covered
